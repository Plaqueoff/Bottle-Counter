This zip contains the following:

    Folder of images 'edgeFigs' where the detected bottles have been marked.

    Python file 'fileBottleCounter.py' which has functions with which
    one can count bottles in an image. To count bottles in an image
    remove the '#' from the last line of the file and insert the relative path
    of the image from the python file into the function.

    PDF file of the report 'report.pdf'

    Text file of the results of counting the bottles in all the given images.

I felt i should include the images with the detected bottles and results of the
program seperately as the program is pretty slow.
