These things exist:

Folder of images 'edgeFigs' where the detected bottles have been marked.

Python file 'fileBottleCounter.py' which has functions with which
one can count bottles in an image. To count bottles in an image
remove the '#' from the last line of the file and insert the relative path
of the image from the python file into the function. 
(i don't know why i felt the need to explain this, the file isn't very complicated)

Text file of the results of counting the bottles in all the given images.
